Privacy Policy for Rhythma
Last updated: 2025-04-02

Rhythma (“the Application”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is an open source period tracker application. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding any personal data or other information you may interact with while using Rhythma.

Data Collection and Storage

We prioritize your privacy. Rhythma stores your primary period tracking and related information locally on your device. In addition, for enhanced data security, synchronization, and feature delivery, certain data may also be stored in a secure, privacy-compliant database managed by us. All data stored in this database adheres to industry standards for secrecy and integrity.

We collect **anonymous and non-identifiable usage data** for the sole purpose of improving the Application's performance, features, and overall user experience. This data includes:
- Telemetry: Information about application crashes, performance metrics, and general usage patterns (e.g., feature usage frequency). This data is aggregated and cannot be linked back to individual users.
- Analysis: Statistical insights derived from aggregated, anonymous data to understand user needs and inform future development.

This unidentifiable data is not linked to you personally and does not contain any sensitive personal information.

What happens if I uninstall the app?

If you uninstall the Application, all your locally stored data will be deleted from your device. Data stored in our database, being non-identifiable, will be retained for analytical purposes but cannot be re-associated with you.

Since Rhythma primarily uses non-identifiable data and is committed to privacy:

- Your identifiable data is not sold to or shared with any third party.
- Your data (identifiable or unidentifiable) is not used for advertising.
- Your data (identifiable or unidentifiable) is not used for marketing purposes.

Third-Party Services

Rhythma is an open source application. We strive to minimize reliance on third-party services that collect or process your data. Any third-party services integrated for database hosting, telemetry, or analytics will be selected based on their commitment to privacy and compatibility with GPLv3 principles. If you choose to share or upload your data via other third-party tools or services (e.g., exporting data to another application), you are subject to their respective privacy policies.

Device Security

While Rhythma stores data locally on your device and securely in our database, it is important to note the following:

- You are responsible for the security of your device.
- We are not responsible for any unauthorized access to your data due to a lack of security on your device.

Children's Privacy

Rhythma is intended for a general audience and does not deliberately collect any information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child’s data has been stored in the Application, please contact us immediately so we can take appropriate action.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Your continued use of Rhythma indicates that you accept such changes.
